Mysterious Windows Batch/Cmd scripts -- My personal, public exposition.

## Please world, see my junk... No I don't care what you think.
- [md5.cmd](../master/md5.cmd ) -- hashes files and directories with optional recursion, unicode and logging options
- [ah.fu.cmd](../master/ah.fu.cmd ) -- Grossly overengineered process killer which reads a conf file to change behavior
  - [eph.u.conf](../master/eph.u.conf ) -- dubbed "process-hitlist" is an example of a conf for [ah.fu.cmd](../master/ah.fu.cmd )
